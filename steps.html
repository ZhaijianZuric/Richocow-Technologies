    <h2>Setting Up a Computer Server: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    <h6>Written by: Kurt Russel Fernandez<br>Published by: Richocow Technologies<br>May 08, 2024</h6>
    <p><h8>In the digital age, businesses and organizations rely heavily on efficient and secure computer servers.  These workhorses operate behind the scenes, but their configuration is crucial for smooth network operation.  Just like a conductor leads an orchestra, server configuration fine-tunes various settings to ensure all network components work together in harmony.  By understanding these key configuration functions,  you'll gain the knowledge to build a robust and reliable foundation for your IT infrastructure. Here are the steps in setting up a computer server:</p>
    <p><h7>A. Formatting</h7><br><h8>Before installing the operating system, you'll need to format the server's hard drive. This erases all existing data and prepares the drive for a fresh installation.Just follow the following steps and procedures:</p>
        <p><h9>Steps of Formatting</h9><br><h8>Insert a bootable flash drive > Press F2 and delete upon restarting > Press any key (if required)
> Select language (English) > Select operating system (Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard
Full Installation) > Click I accept > Select custom > Delete all partitions > Multiply .50 or .60
on the default size then apply (it depend on the given percentages) > Click Ok > Click
unallocated and new and apply > Click Partition 2 > Click Next > Wait to finish > Click Restart
Now > Eject the flash Drive > Wait to complete > Click Ok > To log in type the password
with complexity > Wait to open > Insert the flash drive w/ driver pack > Open the driver pack
solution > Install drivers > Start Installation > Wait for 10-15minutes > Restart the computer > Remove the flash drive.</h8></p>
    <p><h7>B. IP Address and Computer Name</h7><br><h8>Once the operating system is installed, you need to configure the server's IP address. This unique address identifies the server on the network and allows other devices to communicate with it. You'll also assign a computer name to the server for easier identification.</p>
    <p><h9>Steps of Configuring IP Address and Computer Name</h9><br><h8>Server PC > Go to Desktop > Check the LAN Connection > click “Open Network and
Sharing Center/LOCAL AREA CONNECTION > Click Properties > Uncheck
4th
IPV6 > Double click IPV4 > Use the following assigned IP addresses by your assessor (IP
Address, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.) > Use the IP address of the router as your default
gateway and copy the IP address of your PC and put it as your Preferred DNS Server>Click
Ok > Go to this PC or my computer > Go to change settings > Go to change > Change the
computer name > Click Ok > Close All > Restart Now > Recheck IP Address. </h8></p>
    <p><h7>C. Change Router and Access Point's Name</h7><br><h8>For manageability and security purposes, you can rename your router and access point's SSID (wireless network name). This helps you distinguish your network from others and allows for easier connection.</p>
    <p><h9>Steps of Changing Router and Access Point's Name</h9><br><h8>Open Internet Explorer or any browser > Go to search button > Input the IP Address of the router or access point > Type the username (admin) and password (admin) > Click Add > Click Add again > Click Close > Go to Wireless > Change the wireless router or access point name then Scroll Down > Click Save > Click close.</h8>
    </p>
    <p><h7>D. Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)</h7><br><h8>Active Directory is a directory service that plays a central role in Windows Server networks. It stores information about all network resources, including users, computers, printers, and more.<br><h8>This allows for centralized management and access control. Before anything else, you should have done server formatting, drivers’ installation, IP Address
with router and access point’s security and name configuration and also sever-PC name.<br><h8>
Since Windows 2000, Active Directory has been the driving force behind Microsoft Server
Networking Services. Active Directory provides the structure to centralize the network and store
        information about network resources across the entire domain.Active Directory uses Domain Controllers to keep this centralized storage available to network users.In this scenario we are going to install Active Directory fresh with a brand-new Domain Controller after an install of Windows Server 2008 R2.</h8></p>
        <p>Note: Your domain name should be reliably unique. Do not use the same domain as your website, for example, and avoid extensions like .local unless you have registered that domain name in DNS. We suggest a domain name that is not used for anything else, like css.com, tesda.org, slhs.edu and others</p>
    <p><h9>Shortcut Steps to setup Active Directory on Windows Server 2008 </h9><br><h8>Press Windows+R > Type DCPROMO > Press enter and wait > Check the box > Click Next >
Click Next > Check the box > Click Next > Check create a new domain in a new forest > Click
Next > type domain (example: tesda.org) > Click Next > Click Next > Choose Windows Server
2008 R2 > Click Next > Click Next > Click Yes > Click Next > Type Password (P@$$w0rd) >
        Click on the box (reboot on completion) > Restart > Check IP Address > recheck IP addresses.</h8></p>
    <p><h7>E. Adding Roles</h7><br><h9>1. DCHP Server</h9><br><h8>In charge in setting up the IP addresses range that will be given to the client PCs
that will be connected in the server
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a core infrastructure service on any
network that provides IP addressing and DNS server information to PC clients and any other device.
Installing Windows Server 2008 DCHP Server is easy. DHCP Server is now a “role” of
Windows Server 2008.<br><h8>To do this, you will need a Windows Server 2008 system already installed
and configured with a static IP address. You will need to know your network’s IP address range, the
range of IP addresses you will want to hand out to your PC clients, your DNS server IP addresses,
and your default gateway.<br><h8>Additionally, you will want to have a plan for all subnets involved, what
scopes you will want to define, and what exclusions you will want to create. To start the DHCP installation process, you can click Add Roles from the Initial Configuration Tasks window or
        from Server Manager / Roles / Add Roles.</h8></p>
    <p><h9>2. File Services</h9><br><h8>In a server network provide a centralized location for storing and managing
files and data that can be accessed by multiple users within the network. The main functions of
        file services include:</h8></p>
    <p><h8>i. File Storage: File services allow users to store their files, documents, and data in a secure and
organized manner on a central server. This centralized storage makes it easier for users to
access, share, and collaborate on files.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>ii. File Sharing:  Users can easily share files with others on the network by granting permissions
and access rights to specific folders or files. This facilitates collaboration and teamwork among
users in the network.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>iii. Data Backup and Recovery: File services often include backup and recovery features to
protect data from loss due to accidental deletion, hardware failure, or other issues. Regular
        backups ensure that important files are safe and can be recovered if needed.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>iv. Access Control: Administrators can set permissions and access controls to regulate who can
view, edit, or delete files within the network. This helps maintain data security and
confidentiality.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>v. File Synchronization: File services may offer synchronization capabilities, ensuring that files are
up to date across devices and locations. This is particularly useful for users who work on
multiple devices or need access to files remotely.
</h8></p>
    <p><h9>3. Print and document services </h9><br><h8>Print and document services in a server network facilitate the management and sharing of
documents and enable users to print documents from their devices to network-connected printers.
The main functions of print and document services include:</h8></p>
    <p><h8>i. Print Queue Management: Print services allow users to send print jobs to a centralized print
queue on the server. The server manages the print queue, prioritizes print jobs, and sends
them to the designated printer for printing.
</h8></p>
    <p><h8>ii. Printer Sharing: Users can access and use shared printers on the network, eliminating the
need for individual printers at each workstation. Print and document services make it easy to
share printers among multiple users, reducing costs and improving efficiency
</h8></p>
    <p><h8>iii. Driver Management: Print services handle driver installation and management for network
printers. Users can easily connect to printers without needing to install printer drivers on their
devices manually.
</h8></p>
    <p><h8>iv. Print Job Monitoring: Administrators can monitor print usage, track printing costs, and
generate reports on print activities within the network. This helps in managing resources
effectively and optimizing printing workflows.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>v. Document Management: Document services provide a platform for storing, organizing, and
sharing electronic documents within the network. Users can access, collaborate on, and
manage documents centrally from the server.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>vi. Security and Authentication: Print and document services offer security features such as
user authentication, access controls, and encryption to protect sensitive documents and
ensure that only authorized users can print or access confidential information.</h8></p>
    <p><h9>Steps to add roles: DHCP Server, File services, Print and Document services</h9><br><h8>Click the Server Manager Icon > Scroll down > Go to Add Roles > Click Next > Choose
DHCP Server, file services and print and document services > Click Next > Click Next Again >
Check the IP Address > Click Next > Click Validate > Click Next > Click Next > Click Add >
Type the scope name (usually USERS) > input the starting and ending IP Addresses (it depend on
the assigned IP addresses) > Input the default gateway of your Server PC>Click Ok > Click Next >
Click Disable DHCPv6 > Click Next > Click Next > Click Next > Click Next > Click Next > Click
Install (result must be installation succeeded, if not recheck/remove roles and do it again but this may
have some negative effects sometimes).
</h8></p>
    <p><h7>F. Make Folder Redirection </h7><br><h8>All of the shared folders of the clients connected to the server PC will be saved
in the redirection folder. Folder redirection allows you to automatically redirect specific folders on client computers (desktops/laptops) to a central location on the server. This ensures users have their files readily available from any connected device and simplifies data backup and management.</p>
    <p><h8>Server PC > Go to file explorer > Go to my computer/this PC > Go to Local Disk C >
Format Local Disk C > Enter Drive D > Make new folder (FOLDER REDIRECTION
/Redirection) > Right click the folder then go to Properties > Go to sharing > Go to Advanced
Sharing > Click the box (Share this folder) > Click the permissions (allow all) > Click Ok > Apply
then close > Copy the network path > Go to Security Tab> Advanced>Change Permission>
Add >Type everyone > Check Names > ok</h8></p>
    <p><h7>G. Active Directory Users and Computers</h7><br><h8>Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) is a tool used to manage user accounts, groups, computers, and other objects within an Active Directory domain. It allows administrators to create, modify, and delete users, assign permissions, and manage group memberships. ADUC helps managing user accounts, groups, computers,
and organizational units within an Active Directory environment. Here are some key functions of ADUC
        within a server network:</p>
    <p><h8>i. User Account Management: ADUC allows administrators to create, modify, and delete user
accounts. They can set password policies, account permissions, group memberships, and other
user-specific settings.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>ii. Group Management: Administrators can create security and distribution groups, manage group
memberships, and assign permissions to groups. This helps in simplifying user access control and
        permissions management.</h8></p>
    <p><h8>iii. Computer Management: ADUC enables administrators to manage computer objects within the
Active Directory. They can join computers to the domain, configure computer-specific settings,
        and apply group policies to computer accounts.</h8></p>
<p><h8>iv. Organizational Unit (OU) Management: OUs are containers within Active Directory that help
organize and manage objects like users, groups, and computers. ADUC allows administrators to
    create OUs, delegate administrative tasks, and apply group policies at the OU level.</h8></p>
<p><h8>v. Group Policy Management: ADUC integrates with Group Policy Management to apply and
manage group policies across the network. Administrators can configure settings related to
security, desktop configurations, software installations, and more through group policies.</h8></p>
    <p><h9>Steps of ADUC configuration</h9><br><h8>Server PC > Go to Administrative Tools > Go to Active Directory Users and Computers
> Go to the + sign of the tesda.org > Highlight tesda.org > Right click and click New > Go to
Organizational Unit > type assigned name (example: CSS Lab) > Click Ok > Right click CSS
Lab > Click New and Users > type assigned users’ name > user login name > Click Next > type
password (P@$$W0rd) – base on the given password > Click Next > Click Finish > Create another
user/s. >
Highlight the first user > Right click and properties > Go to profile > Paste the copied network
path a while back > Click on connect > Choose D > Put the network path to “To” > Click Apply >
Click Ok > Do the same steps to the other users.</h8></p>
    <p><h7>H. Group Policy Management</h7><br><h8>The Group Policy Management function in a server network allows administrators to manage
and apply group policies across multiple computers within a network. Group policies help in
controlling user accounts, computer settings, security configurations, and more, centrally from a
server. <br><h8>It ensures consistency in settings and security configurations across all connected devices
within the network. Group Policy Management is a tool used to create and apply group policies across multiple computers in a domain. Group policies define settings that control user accounts, computer configurations, security options, and more. This ensures consistency and simplifies management across all devices.</p>
    <p><h9>Steps of GPM Configuration</h9><br><h8>Go to Start Button > Go to Administrative Tools > Find Group Policy Management > Go to
+ Forest > Go to Domain’-“tesda.org” > Go to + tesda.org > Highlight Tesda and right click > Click
“Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here…” > Type name (FOLDER
REDIRECTION/Redirection) > Click Ok.</h8><br><h8>Right Click Default Configuration > Go to edit > Select Computer Configuration > Select

etc.)</h8><br><h8>Right click on the icon > properties > Select (Basic) Setting > Paste the copied network path > Click
Apply > Click Yes > Click Ok > Do these to the other icons.</h8><br><h8>Update the policy through command prompt (cmd) > go to cmd > type gpupdate /force > enter >
restart > log in>recheck IP address</h8></p>
    <p><h7>I. Joining Clients (Desktop and/or Laptop)</h7><br><h8>Client computers (desktops/laptops) need to be joined to the domain to access network resources and benefit from centralized management. The joining process involves configuring the client's network settings and domain membership.</p>
    <p><h9>Steps of Joining Clients</h9><br><h8>Change the computer name for desktop if needed, for laptop no need > Make sure that you
have connection to the domain (tesda.org) > Make sure to Turn off firewall of Client and Server PC>
Turn on all Network Sharing Options in the Advanced Sharing Settings of Client and Server PC
>Set a Static IP address of the Client PC that is within the IP address scope that was set> Use the
IP address of the Server as the Preferred DNS Server of the client PC> Ping the client and server
PC>Recheck the Network sharing options and make sure all are turned on.</h8><br><h8>Client PC>Go to my computer or this PC > Right click > Properties > Click to Change
Settings > Click Change > Type the name required > Click the Domain > Type the Domain name
(tesda.org) > Click OK > Type the name (administrator) > type the password of server > Click OK > Close all the open apps > Restart the computer > Click other user > Log in using user’s name and
        password > Create folder in the icon you’ve configured in the GPM.</h8></p>
    <p><h7>J. Testing Folder Redirection</h7><br><h8>After configuring folder redirection, it's important to verify that it's working correctly. This involves testing access to the redirected folders on client computers and ensuring proper permissions are set.
    <p><h9>Testing a Folder</h9><br><h8>Double click on the folder (ex. DOCUMENTS) under Drive C or D > Click Continue >
Click Security Tab > Click Continue > Select Administration (TESDA/Admin) > Click Apply
> Click OK > Click OK > Click Close > Double-click the folder again > Click Continue > Repeat
the process on the other folders > until you see and test the folder created in the client desktop/laptop
(you can do this vice versa).</h8></p>
    <p><h7>K. Remote Desktop Connection</h7><br><h8>Remote Desktop Connection allows you to remotely access and control another computer from your own device. This is useful for administrators to manage servers and troubleshoot issues without needing physical presence.
    <p><h9>Steps of Remoting a Desktop Connection</h9><br><h8>Ping the PCs that you want to connect using the “Remote Desktop App” > turn off the firewall
for both PCs.> Make sure to Log off the PC that you want to access in the Remote desktop after
configuring their settings
